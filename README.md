Each class grants a special skill, that a hero can use in battle. Heroes can attack, use a special skill or skip turns. Their attacks depend on their stamina and the stats of their equipment, the usage of a skil depends on stamina as well. The hero who lost all of it's health points first loses.

This project was an excercize of the best practices of object-oriented programming, as well as an example of the not so harmful use of the singleton pattern. When I was doing this project, I mostly repeated after the tutor and barely understood anything. So, after that, I looked into other sources to gain more in-depth perspective about design patterns. Now I understand what is going on in this app, but, as I write this, I still haven't written a single app using some of the patterns by myself.

The frontend part was provided by the tutors.
